## Usage
Get a local copy of the repository by downloading the zip or using `git clone`. This includes a makefile, so assuming you're in a UNIX-like environment, you can `make` the project.

Then, depending on your operating system/environment, you can run the program by using one of the following commands:

```
./ppmrw.exe 3 input.ppm output.ppm
```
```
ppmrw 3 input.ppm output.ppm
```

Detailed usage information can be viewed by using the flag `-h`:

```
./ppmrw.exe -h
```
```
ppmrw -h
```
